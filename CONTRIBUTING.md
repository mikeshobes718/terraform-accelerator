# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting started
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Keep commits small and focused; write clear messages
- Update docs/examples when applicable

## Development principles
- Prefer idempotent, observable changes with dry-run where possible
- Avoid breaking changes; document them if unavoidable

## Pull Requests
- Link related issues and describe motivation/approach
- Include tests or examples where helpful
- Be open to feedback and iteration
